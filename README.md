# British Airways Virtual Internship: Analyzing Customer Booking Behavior

## Overview
This repository contains my solution for Task 2 of the British Airways virtual internship, focusing on analyzing customer booking behavior. The project aims to gain insights from a dataset containing customer booking details and flight information using Python and machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure
- **data**: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks documenting the data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training.
- **scripts**: Python scripts for specific tasks, such as data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- **results**: Holds the results and outputs generated during the analysis.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:


2. Install the required dependencies:


3. Explore the project notebooks in the `notebooks` directory for detailed analysis steps.

## Results
The XGBoost classifier achieved an accuracy of 85% on the validation set, providing valuable insights into customer booking behavior.

## Future Improvements
- Fine-tuning model hyperparameters to potentially improve performance.
- Incorporating additional features or data sources for deeper analysis.
- Deploying the model for real-time prediction or integration into British Airways systems.
